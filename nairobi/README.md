# Nairobi CSS - A responsive framework for multilingual literacy sites

Nairobi CSS is a framework for building responsive, mobile-friendly, multilingual literacy websites. It was developed for use on the [Storybooks Canada](http://storybookscanada.ca) website, and has since been used as the basis for multiple other sites serving different regions and languages via the [Global Storybooks](http://globalstorybooks.net) platform.

## Features

* **Responsive**: Mobile-first design looks great on any screen size or device.
* **Lightweight**: Designed from the ground up to be fast and light on resources for use in locations without high-speed Internet.
* **Portable**: The whole site can be downloaded and hosted locally, or made available on a local network for situations where no Internet is available.
* **Configurable**: Most aspects of the site can be changed from a single configuration file.
* **Multimedia**: Images and audio integrated on every page for a rich reading experience.
* **Easy to use**: Large, friendly buttons and clear, discoverable features for users of any age and skill level.
* **Interactive features**: Auto-highlighting, quick language switcher, and other features available out of the box.
* **Navigation options**: Group and sort stories by language or reading level. Quickly skip through pages and between linked stories.

## Demo

## Installation

Nairobi CSS is built with Jekyll, so you will need to have Ruby and Jekyll installed in order to build the site.

Enter the project folder and run:

    jekyll build

The rendered site will be in the `_site` folder.
